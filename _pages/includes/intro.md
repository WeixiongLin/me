Hello! I'm Weixiong Lin (林玮雄).

I work at TikTok <img src='./images/tiktok.png' style='width: 6em;'> as a research scientist now in Singapore. 

I am now working on audio-driven talking face generation, text-to-speech and music generation research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [wx_lin@outlook.com](mailto:wx_lin@outlook.com).
