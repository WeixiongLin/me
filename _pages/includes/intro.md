Hello! I'm Weixiong Lin (林玮雄).

I'm an algorithm researcher of TikTok Search Department.
The vision is to develop general multi-modal technologies for various applications with global influence (tiktok, lemon8, etc), such as superlarge-scale pre-training for image/text/video contents, guided with reinforcement learning.

Before that, I explore with some outstanding researchers from Future Living Laboratory (未来生活实验室), Alibaba, working to develop large-scale searching & question-answering system (拍立淘), one of the largest visual/multi-modal application scenarios in China.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Weidi Xie](https://weidixie.github.io/)(海外优青) and [Prof. Ya Zhang](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/yazhang/)(国家万人), also collaborating with [Prof. Yanfeng Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=x_sgJskAAAAJ)(人工智能学院院长) in [MediaBrain Group](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
